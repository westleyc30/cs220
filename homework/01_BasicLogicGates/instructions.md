# Homework1: Basic Logic Gates

## Not, And, Or, Xor

### Background:

A typical computer architecture is based on a set of elementary logic gates like And, Or, etc., as well as other more complex chips. This project engages you in the construction of a typical set of basic logic gatesand focuses on the documentation and building the code. These gates form the elementary building blocks from which more complex chips will be later constructed, and which youâ€™ll have to come up with the solutions for on your own.

### Objective:

Build someof thelogic gatesdescribed in Chapter 1 (see list below), yielding a basic chip-set. The only building blocks that you can use in this project are primitive Nand gates and the composite gates that you will gradually build on top of them.

### Contract:

Whenloaded into the supplied Hardware Simulator, your chip design (modified .hdl program), tested on the supplied .tst script, should produce the outputs listed in the supplied .cmp file. If that is not the case, the simulator will let you know.

### Grading method:

If the chip passes allthe tests specified in the supplied test script, it receivestwo thirds of its allotted points. The remaining third reflects the documentation provided for each chip.What do you turn in?A Word document (or PDF) with screen shots of each of the working (or not) logic gates. You should also upload the documentation.pdf file (see Documentation Instructions for guidelines on how to do this)per Project Submission Guidelines.
